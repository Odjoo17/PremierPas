Here is the list of project that I want to realise, feel free to add some challenging ideas :)
- Olympics medals : Scrap the number of medals won by each country for all the modern olympics event
- Legislatives 2024 : Try to quantify the impact of the "Front RÃ©publicain" during the second round of the legislatives in France in June 2024
- Titanic : Try to do the first ML project of Kaggle
- Marathon pour tous : Try to get all the data from the net and create an app where we can find anyone from their names and not their number
- Create a CV online on git
-
